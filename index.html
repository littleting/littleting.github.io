                <p>We are responsible for conducting <em><strong>usability testings</strong></em> before lauching a new version of both K+ and K+ Market.</p>
<p>Ideally, face-to-face usability is more preferrable. However, due to covid-19 situation, we conducted our usability testings remotely. To do so, we built prototypes for both K+ and K+ Market using Figma. Then, sent over the protytpe link to our participants where they share their screen as they are interacting with the prototype according to tasks we assigned to them.</p>
<p>Challenges we encoutered during remote usability testing&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>Interactions on computer are different from interaction on mobile phones. Scrolling is intuitive on mobile phones. However, we noticed that we always needed to remind our participants that this page is scrollable. Participants also mentioend explicitly that they forgot as this is done through computer and some were not quite familiar with it.</li>
<li>We have no control of what happening on our participants' computer. Using prototype feature on Figma for face-to-face computer allows both us and participant to control the prototype. We can go easily go back to different pages using desktop figma, while participants can click and navigate the prototype as they have a converstaion with us. With remote usability, we have to ask the participants to push a certain button to go back to a certain page then we can start asking questions. This disrupts the flow of the sessions and make a session longer than it is supposed to be.</li>
<li>Swtiching between several things. Remote usability testing requires participants to use at least 2 things at the same time: a telecommunication software, and a browser for our prototype. They also need to copy an URL or click on a link to open our prototype. Switching between all these pages could be confusing for participants who are not familiar with computer and technology in general. We once have elderlies as our participants, which we had tp kindly ask their youger relatives to setup everything for them as well as standby closely in case there are any technical issues. Also, internet quality is a restriction we always need to take into consideration.</li>

                <p><a href="https://eatable.kasikornbank.com/">Eatable</a> is an ordering platform for restaurants. Eatable allows digital dine-in ordering, makie it easier for customers to order their food wihtout having to wait for a waiter. Eatable also offers order managerment for restaurants, supporting dine-in, take-away, and delivery.</p>
<p>My work was to find ways to make Eatable better for both restaurants and restaurant customers. To do so, we conducted UX research with both restaurants and customers.</p>

<h5 id="research-with-restuarants" class="anchor-link"><a href="#research-with-restuarants">Research with restuarants</a></h5>
<p>We <em><strong>observed</strong></em> and <em><strong>interviewed</strong></em> with restaurant owners to understand the whole process of their operations. The interviews were to understand their expectation from a digital ordering system.</p>

<h5 id="research-with-customers" class="anchor-link"><a href="#research-with-customers">Research with customers</a></h5>
<p>We conducted a <em><strong>diary study</strong></em> with participants who frequently dine-in and order takeaway to understand their behaviors and interactions with different touchpoints of restaurants. LineOA was the main tool for the participants to submit their diary.</p>
<p>We <em><strong>interviewed</strong></em> the participants for deeper understanding of their dine-in and takeaway experience at restaurants as well as their expectations for restaurant services. We also asked the participants to try using Eatable, pretending they were at a restaurant and use Eatable with their own phone.</p>

                <p>Simple and low bandwidth communications <strong>on computers</strong> has been found to promate intinacy between couple, what if such minimual communications are packed in <strong>forms of wearables</strong>. This work explors this concept further through a <em><strong>co-design workshop</strong></em>, <em><strong>lo-fidelity proprototyes</strong></em>, and a <em><strong>diary study</strong></em>.</p>

<h4 id="co-design-workshops" class="anchor-link"><a href="#co-design-workshops">Co-design workshops</a></h4>
<p>In the workshops, we invited 16 participants who were at the moment in the middle of long-distant relationship to explore potential of wearable devices in facilitating interactions and communications with their partner. We introduced them to the concept of low bandwidth display <a href="https://decochrom.com/">DecoChrom</a>. Then, the participants worked in groups to design a wearable device that they would like to use based on the technology and later roleplayed how they envisioned their device being used and why it is useful for certain scenarios (as shown in figure 2).</p>

<h4 id="lo-fi-prototody-and-diary-study" class="anchor-link"><a href="#lo-fi-prototody-and-diary-study">Lo-fi prototody and diary study</a></h4>
<p>We bult 4 lo-fi prototypes based on the ideas from the workshops. We invited 8 participants (2 for each design) to use the prototype of their idea for 2 days. Our goal was to gain a rich understanding for
The  For the 2-day, we sent them questions through WhatsApp and asked them to report back as text and pictures of how they feel about the device if they would use it to send and receive message with their partner and how they feel about using the device as they go about doing their day-to-day activities.</p>

<h4 id="summary-of-the-findings" class="anchor-link"><a href="#summary-of-the-findings">Summary of the findings</a></h4>
<p>Unlike for computer, low-bandwidth communication on wearable devices has a challenge of user not noticing a message when received, especially if it is in a form of, for example, a necklace. This potentially decreases the feeling of being passively connected. Having only the display is not enough. The participants thought that having a virating module would greatly improve the prototype.<br>
While a ring form factor is more visible and more noticeable compared to the necklace, the form raised a usability issue related to intention of interaction. The ring does offer intuitive interactions, but it is also prone for unintented interactions, which makes the message less special.</p>
<p>This is one of my postdoc reserach at the University of Lapland, Finland, together with Hong Li, Emmi Harjunieni, Heiko Müller, and Jonna Häkkailä.</p>

                <p>Linn dress integrated wearable displays with controllable transparency, as a technique to control body exposure and alter the look and feel of the dress. Linn Dress presents a novel way to use wearable displays as a cover of the body, rather than the more typical wearable display applications &ndash; an embellishment or information visualization channel.</p>
<p>Linn Dress has cut out areas  that the wearers can dynamically adjust the transparency of ,revealing or convering the underlying body. The dynamic areas are located at the neckline and in in the back of the dress. The transparency is controlled through the use of electrochomic diplays (<a href="https://decochrom.com/">DecoChorm</a>), which can switch between two states: higher and lower opacity.</p>
<p>This vesion of Linn Dress focuses on technology exploration, particularly to understand the potential and limitations of electrochormic diplsays as a body covering. We found that smaller displays work better in terms of switching time and contrast between states.</p>
